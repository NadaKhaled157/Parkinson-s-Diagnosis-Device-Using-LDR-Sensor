## Project Overview
A device made to help doctors diagnose patients with Parkinson's disease and follow-up on its progression.
## Application Idea
Parkinson's Disease affects the nervous system and causes hand tremors.
## Parameters 
<p align="justify"> The light source in the device is a laser pointer. Itâ€™s a small battery-operated device containing a laser diode that emits a very narrow coherent laser beam, making it a potent signaling tool. The coherence of the light beam is an important property for the accuracy of the device. The laser has an intensity of 5mW/mm2, has a spot size of 1mm2, and emits a beam of wavelength 473 nm. </p>
